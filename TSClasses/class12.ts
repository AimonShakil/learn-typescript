//13 aInheritence  is parent child relationship , parent calss (based class) and child class (derived class )
// why we create class, for reusabilty , class k throug modularize kr sakte hai scalability only takes place through classes approach used is classes
//it also gives different concepts and to organize our code 
// base class and parent class: we want to simplify code to enhance readability

//13B : to make multiple class, we can create object and purpose to make abstract class and in which cases we can use abstract class
// Initialize nae krty Object nae bhnta, no constructor 
// for Abstract class is like a blue print most generic template or structure and cannot create objects directly 

//13 C Constructor: what are constructor - to initialize class and if we dont use, it is by defult, purpose is to initilize object
